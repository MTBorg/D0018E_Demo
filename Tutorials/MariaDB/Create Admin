To create an admin for your database that has all privileges on all databases and tables you have to log in as root. 

In the root of the database (no database selected etc) type:
CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'adminpass';
  then type
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'admin'@'localhost'; 

This is the user used in dbConnect, dbCreate, dbInit.
